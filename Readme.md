# Post Redirect Get (PRG) Pattern Implementation

This repository contains [an example implementation of the Post Redirect Get (PRG) pattern](https://codereviewvideos.com/post-redirect-get-pattern-example/) in web development using NodeJS, Express, TypeScript, Nunjucks, and Gov UK front end. The PRG pattern is a design approach that ensures secure handling of form submissions in web applications.

## Overview

In this project, we cover the following key aspects:

- Explanation of the PRG pattern and its benefits.
- Implementation of a simple website with two journeys using the PRG pattern.
- Example views and common controller actions for both approaches (with and without PRG).
- Clear demonstration of how PRG prevents duplicate form submissions and enhances user experience.
